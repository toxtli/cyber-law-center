    <h3>Visualizing Targeted Audiences</h3>
<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QswpTk7q-dk/UxdLxpVK3jI/AAAAAAAAHhA/XC5B5gP3ZnU/s1600/interfaces.png" width="520">
<p></p>Users of social networks can be passionate about sharing their political convictions, art projects, or business ventures. They often want to direct their social interactions to certain people in order to start collaborations or to raise awareness about issues they support. However, users generally have scattered, unstructured information about the characteristics of their audiences, making it difficult for them to deliver the right messages or interactions to the right people. 
Existing audience-targeting tools allow people to select potential candidates based on predefined lists, but the tools provide few insights about whether or not these people would be appropriate for a specific type of communication. We introduce an online tool, \textit{Hax}, to explore instead the idea of using interactive data visualizations to help people dynamically identify audiences for 
their different sharing efforts. We provide the results of a preliminary empirical evaluation that shows the strength of the idea and points to areas for future research.

<h3>Directed Social Queries with Transparent User Models</h3>
<img src="https://www.evl.uic.edu/creativecoding/_pubs/Forbes_DSQ.png" width="620">

<p>The friend list of many social network users can be very large. This creates challenges when users seek to direct their social interactions to friends that share a particular interest or friends that have the potential of being able to answer a particular question. We present a self-organizing online tool that by incorporating ideas from user modeling and data visualization allows a person to quickly identify which friends best match a social query, enabling precise and efficient directed social interactions. To cover the different modalities in which our tool might be used, we introduce two different interactive visualizations. One view enables a human-in-the-loop approach for result analysis and verification, and, in a second view, location, social affiliations and "personality" data is incorporated, allowing the user to quickly consider different social and spatial  factors when directing social queries. We report on a qualitative analysis, which indicates that transparency leads to an increased effectiveness of the system. This work contributes a novel method for exploring online friends.

<h3>Location Based Context Aware Recommendation System</h3>
           <img  src=" http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vx1SxMnL6Jw/TyXJ1gx7miI/AAAAAAAACAY/7_n-tRIms4w/s1600/rec.png" width="550">
         
            <p>Research in ubiquitous location recommendation systems has focused on automatically inferring a user's preferences while little attention has been devoted to the recommendation algorithms.Location recommendation systems with a focus on recommendation algorithms generally require the user to complete complicated and time consuming surveys and rarely consider the users current context. The purpose of this investigation is to design a more complete ubiquitous location based recommendation algorithm that by inferring users preferences and considering time geography and similarity measurements automatically, betters the user experience. Our system learns user preferences by mining a persons social network profile. The physical constraints are delimited by a users location, and form of transportation, which is automatically detected through the use of a decision tree followed by a discrete Hidden Markov Model. We defined a decision-making model, which considers the learned preferences, physical constraints and how the individual is currently feeling. Our recommendation algorithm is based on a text classification problem. The detection of the form of transportation and the user interface was implemented on the Nokia N900 phone, the recommendation algorithm was implemented on a server which communicates with the phone. The novelty of our approach relies on the fusion of information inferred from a users social network profile and his/her mobile phones sensors for place discovery.</p>
        


      <h3> Enchantment Under The Sea: An Intelligent Environment For Music Mixing</h3>
    

  <p>Disc Jokeys (DJs) generally mix music in a confined
isolated space. This can make the DJ have depression sentiments
and it can also difficult the DJ's understanding of his public. We
present Enchantment Under The Sea: a new intelligent
environment that allows the disc jokey to roam freely, interact
directly with his audience, receive informative feedback about
the public's social interactions, while also respecting the DJs
privacy concerns. The music interface is controlled using
Microsoft’s wireless touch mouse with ubiquitous gestures that
resemble dance moves. The music mixing interface is displayed
on the walls of the event, where two different display modalities
are enabled: open interface, in which the public can observe all of
the DJ’s decisions with the music mixing interface and also
actively give music suggestions to the DJ. And a closed interface,
where all the music controllers are mapped to sea animals, that
only the DJ knows the mapping to, thus providing privacy to the
DJ’s work. The public's social interactions are measured with
sonar sensors whose data is provided to the DJ through the
musical interface. We report results of a controlled usability
inspection.</p>

            
            <h3>Mmmmmm: A Multi-Modal Musical Mobile Mixer</h3>
            <img  src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53c9cdf3e4b0669c8d19e691/t/53fc115ae4b0dbe9d9a34613/1409028442957/" width="550">
          
            <p>Mmmmm stands for Multimodal Musical Mobile Mixer and itis a new musical DJ application that has been designed for the Nokia n900 phone. This software enables a new type of interaction between the DJ and the crowd. Mmmmm has streaming via bluetooth of the music generated in the phone to wireless speakers, which allows the DJ to move about the environment and get familiarized with the crowd, turning the experience of DJing into an interactive and audience engaging process.It also has Eyes Free mode enabled and it is carried out through hand gestures and haptic feedback, in this way the DJ can focus on the public and have a better intuition of what they are feeling. Mmmmm also has a "Party Detection" mode. By using the phone camera, the party scene is scanned and then a certain type of music as well as a series of songs is suggested. This mode helps novice DJs to instantly have a much better music repertoire, creating the illusion that an expert DJ is selecting the music the crowd is dancing to. Eyes free mixing can be enabled at the wish of the user.</p>
            
            <h3>Wii remote for Arm and Risk therapy in Stroke survivors.</h3>
        
         <p>The Nintendo Wii remote is a compact, readily accessible position, orientation, and motion sensing technology with blue tooth wireless communication. We integrated the 3D position sensor to a gesture therapy system of computer simulated therapy exercises which we had previously developed. We have also used pitch, yaw, and roll, from the Wii remote 3D accelerometer to navigate a fly-through of an arbitrary Direct-X generated terrain. The hardware-based orientation and motion sensing capabilities of the Wii remote complement vision-based systems and interface well with wrist exercises.The Wii remote model is promising for integration into clinical and home-based rehabilitation exercise therapy systems. </p>
            <h3>Time Scheduling using a Genetic Algorithm</h3>
           <img  src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/3327149413_4bf89a693a.jpg" width="550">
         
            <p>The school of Engineering of the National Autonomous University of Mexico has over 10,000 students, this large amount of alumni requires the availability of a great number of courses. The problem is, how do you schedule these courses in the most optimal way? Furthermore what criteria would you use to say that one solution was better than the other? In this project we proposed to solve this problem by means of a genetic algorithm. What we optimized was the time a classroom was utilized, ie we wanted to have continuous classes assigned to it throughout the day,the schedule of each course, we considered that an optimal solution would have courses from the same semester and the same career assigned in rooms that were nearby to each other and in contiguous schedules since this would be beneficial for the students. In our proposed solution we also took into consideration the problem of having 2 different courses assigned in the same time slot or one professor assigned to two different courses in the same time period </p>

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        An intelligent interaction should not typically call attention to
        emotion. However, it almost always involves emotion: For
        example, it should engage, not inflict undesirable stress and
        frustration, and perhaps elicit positive emotions such as joy
        or delight. How would the system sense or recognize if it
        was succeeding in these elements of intelligent interaction?
        This keynote talk will address some ways that our work at
        the MIT Media Lab has advanced solutions for recognizing
        user emotion during everyday experiences.

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>Crowd-sourcing labor markets (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) are booming, because they enable rapid construction of complex workflows that seamlessly mix human computation with computer automation. Example applications range from photo tagging to audio-visual transcription and interlingual translation. Similarly, workflows on citizen science sites (e.g. GalaxyZoo) have allowed ordinary people to pool their effort and make interesting discoveries. Unfortunately, constructing a good workflow is difficult, because the quality of the work performed by humans is highly variable. Typically, a task designer will experiment with several alternative workflows to accomplish a task, varying the amount of redundant labor, until she devises a control strategy that delivers acceptable performance.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, this control challenge can often be formulated as an automated planning problem ripe for algorithms from the probabilistic planning and reinforcement learning literature. I describe our recent work on the decision-theoretic control of crowd sourcing and suggest open problems for future research. In particular, I discuss:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The use of partially-observable Markov decision Processes (POMDPs) to control voting on binary-choice questions and iterative improvement workflows.</li>
        <li>Decision-theoretic methods that dynamically switch between alternative workflows in a way that improves on traditional (static) A-B testing.</li>
        <li>A novel workflow for crowdsourcing the construction of a taxonomy — a challenging problem since it demands a global perspective of the input data when no one worker sees more than a tiny fraction.</li>
        <li>Methods for optimizing the acquisition of labeled training data for use in machine learning applications; this an important special case, since data annotation is often crowd-sourced.</li>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Blurring of the Boundary Between Interactive Search and Recommendation</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>Search and recommendation engines are increasingly more intelligent.  They have become more personalized and social as well as more interactive.  No longer just offering ten blue links, search engines have increasingly been integrated with task and item recommenders directly, for example, to offer news, movie, music, and dining suggestions.  Vice versa, recommendation systems have increasingly became more search-like by offering capabilities that enable users to tune and direct recommendation results instantly.</p>
        <p>As the two technologies evolve toward each other, there is increasingly a blurring of the boundary between these two approaches to interactive information seeking. On the search side, this is driven by the merging of question answering capabilities with search, led by systems like Google Now and Apple Siri that move search toward intelligent personal assistants.  On the recommendation side, there has been a merging of techniques from not just keyword search but also faceted search, along with user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques and other more proactive recommenders.</p>
        <p>This blurring has resulted in both critical re-thinking about not just how to architect the systems by merging and sharing backend components common to both types of systems, but also how to structure the user interactions and experiences.</p>
